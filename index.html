        Ease Arthritis Pain Curcumin contains anti-inflammatory properties, making
        it a potentially effective treatment for inflammatory conditions such as
      arthritis. For example, a small past study found that participants with
      rheumatoid arthritis who took a 500 mg curcumin supplement twice daily for
      eight weeks saw greater improvements in joint tenderness and swelling
      compared with patients who took a prescription anti-inflammatory or a
      combination of the two treatments. Reduce Depression Symptoms Depression
      has been linked with lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF), a protein in the brain and spinal cord that regulates
      communication between nerve cells. In rats, curcumin effectively increased
      levels of BDNF over the course of 10 days, according to a study published
      in Behavioural Brain Research.In humans with major depressive disorder,
      those who took 1,000 mg of curcumin daily for six weeks saw similar
      improvements to those who took an antidepressant or a combination of the
      two treatments, according to a small April 2014 study published in
      Phytotherapy Research.
